# SQL_SSMS-Pyodbc
### Due to the nature of Github not being able to store datafiles above 25MB (*booo*), usual datatables of around ~500MB, generally need another way of accessing them, preferably not locally.
### This is a quick demo of using the pyodbc package to connect to the SSMS wizard of SQL, where the file is hosted on a Windows-Authenticated Server for access and manipulation. This is one of the other methods explored besides the API access in a separate repo
